#3.5.1.1 What happens if you facet on a continuous variable?
#continuous
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid(~ cty)
#categorical
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_grid( ~ model)

#3.5.1.2 What do the empty cells in plot with facet_grid(drv ~ cyl) mean? How do they relate to this plot?

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl)) 

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)

#3.5.1.3 What plots does the following code make? What does . do?

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ .)

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ cyl)


#3.5.1.4 Take the first faceted plot in this section: What are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic
  
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ trans, nrow = 2)

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = trans))
  
  
#3.5.1.5 Read ?facet_wrap. What does nrow do? What does ncol do? What other options control the layout of the individual panels? Why doesnâ€™t facet_grid() have nrow and ncol arguments?
?facet_wrap


#3.5.1.6 When using facet_grid() you should usually put the variable with more unique levels in the columns. Why?
#more space for columns
